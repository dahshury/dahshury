## Repositories ⚙️

### 1. [Back-Machine-Detector](https://github.com/dahshury/Back-Machine-Detector)
A gym back machine detector (7 machines) using **RT-DETRv2** and **YOLOv8** with images from various online datasets. This can be used in real-world scenarios to identify gym machines even when humans are using them. The solution is deployed on **Microsoft Azure's Web Apps** for containers, with a front-end built using **Streamlit**.

### 2. [Human Pose Estimation](https://github.com/dahshury/Human-Pose-Estimation)
Estimating the positions of 25 keypoints on the human body by training an **Hourglass network** (from scratch), **YOLOv8 Pose**, and **Keypoint RCNN**. The model achieves **68% mAP@50** on the validation set, helping to solve problems such as pose tracking and gesture recognition.

---

### 3. [Car Segmentation](https://github.com/dahshury/Car-Segmentation)
A vehicle segmentation project using **UNET** (from scratch), achieving **0.99 pixel accuracy**. The project focuses on separating the vehicle from the background, which is useful for applications in autonomous driving and image analysis.

### 4. [Marble Defect Classifier](https://github.com/dahshury/Marble-Defect-Classifier)
A marble quality classifier implemented using:
- From-scratch implementation of **ResNet34**.
- Pretrained **ResNet50**.
- **Huggingface ViT transformer**.

---

### 5. [Face Recognition](https://github.com/dahshury/face_recognition)
A face recognition system using a **MySQL** database to store and retrieve face embeddings, providing a robust database-backed solution for secure identification and authentication.


---

### 6. [Bank Term Deposit Prediction](https://github.com/dahshury/Bank-term-deposit-prediction)
A classification task predicting whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on 12 features.

---

### 7. [Australian Vehicle Price Prediction](https://github.com/dahshury/Australian-Vehicle-Price-Prediction)
A regression task predicting the prices of Australian vehicles based on 12 features using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, data cleaning, and feature extraction. The solution is deployed on **GCP App Engine** with a **Streamlit** front-end.

---

### 8. [WinSTT](https://github.com/dahshury/WinSTT)
An application for desktop Speech-to-Text (STT) using **Insanely-Fast-Whisper** and **Faster-whisper**, which is a lightweight STT model based on OpenAI’s **Whisper**. The application offers fast transcription and supports over 99 languages without requiring an internet connection. The UI, developed with **PyQT6**, was compiled into an ".exe" file for easy use, including customizable hotkeys and fast transcription ideal for writers or daily use.
