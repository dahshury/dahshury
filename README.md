### 4. [WinSTT](https://github.com/dahshury/WinSTT)

An application for desktop STT using [Insanely-Fast-Whisper](https://github.com/Vaibhavs10/insanely-fast-whisper) and [Faster-whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper)

WinSTT is an application that leverages the power of OpenAI's Whisper STT model for efficient  voice typing functionality. This desktop tool allows users to transcribe speech into text in any application. With support for over 99 languages and the capability to run locally without needing an internet connection.

The existing Windows speech-to-text is slow, inaccurate, and unintuitive. This app provides customizable hotkey activation, and fast and accurate transcription for rapid typing. This is especially useful to those who write articles, blogs, and even in day-to-day conversations.

A UI was also developed into a ".exe" for easier use using PyQT6.
